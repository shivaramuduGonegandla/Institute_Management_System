Database: MySQL (using Spring Data JPA)
Security: Spring Security (for admin login)

Other Dependencies:
Spring MVC
Spring Validation
Spring Data JPA
System Requirements
Java: JDK 11 or later
Spring Boot: 2.x
Database: MySQL
Maven (for building and running the project)
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any Java IDE
Database Setup
The project uses MySQL as the database. To set up the database, use the following SQL script to create the required tables and populate the initial data.

SQL Script for Database Setup
sql
CREATE DATABASE institute_management;

USE institute_management;

-- Create Students Table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    phone VARCHAR(15),
    enrollment_date DATE,
    course_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id)
);

-- Create Courses Table
CREATE TABLE courses (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    duration VARCHAR(50),
    instructor_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (instructor_id) REFERENCES instructors(id)
);

-- Create Instructors Table
CREATE TABLE instructors (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    specialization VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert sample data into Instructors Table
INSERT INTO instructors (name, email, specialization) VALUES
('John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'Mathematics'),
('Jane Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', 'Computer Science');

-- Insert sample data into Courses Table
INSERT INTO courses (name, description, duration, instructor_id) VALUES
('Java Programming', 'Learn the basics of Java programming.', '3 months', 2),
('Mathematics 101', 'Introductory course in Mathematics.', '4 months', 1);

-- Insert sample data into Students Table
INSERT INTO students (name, email, phone, enrollment_date, course_id) VALUES
('Alice Johnson', 'alice.johnson@example.com', '1234567890', '2024-01-15', 1),
('Bob Brown', 'bob.brown@example.com', '0987654321', '2024-02-20', 2);
Running the Project
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/institute-management-software.git
Step 2: Configure MySQL
Make sure MySQL is running on your system and you have created the institute_management database as per the SQL script above.

Step 3: Configure application.properties
In src/main/resources/application.properties, configure your database connection settings:

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/institute_management
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
Step 4: Build and Run the Application
Use Maven to build and run the application:

bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
Alternatively, if you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can run the application directly from there.

Step 5: Access the Application
Once the application is running, open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:8080
